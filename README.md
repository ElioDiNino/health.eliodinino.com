# Personal Health Website
This was my final project on personal health for UBC's NURS 180: Stress and Strategies to Promote Well Being.

The website, as you will see, breaks down some of my best tips on different topics and shares some of the resources from throughout the course. It also gives a small peek into my passion for landscape photography through a few of my photos added to the site (see [my photography site](https://photography.eliodinino.com) for more images). I chose to make a website because I have a passion for programming, and because I have never programmed a website from scratch before (in the past I always used website builders such as Wix and Squarespace). Creating this website was challenging for me, but it also fulfilled my passion to continuously learn and taught me valuable skills for future websites I build. I hope that the website can also be a helpful resource for others!
