            <p class="page-description">Welcome to my website dedicated to personal health.
                The goal of the site is to provide a calming space to develop and practice your self-care routine with.

                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>As you read below you will find exercises and resources for working on your self-care
                    routine. If you don't already know, <b>self-care</b> is the practice of taking action to preserve or
                    improve your health and wellbeing. Practicing self-care allows you to live healthier and happier,
                    and it better prepares you for whatever life throws at you.<br><br>The self-care content below
                    ranges in topic and you are welcome to explore the topics that interest you most. That being said, I
                    encourage you to look at every section because you may find something new that you enjoy by stepping
                    outside of your comfort zone. One last note is that throughout the site you will see landscape
                    photos as visuals. These are photos I have taken and added to the site to liven it up.</p>

                <h1>Deep Breathing</h1>
                <p>One of the easiest ways to manage stress and relax is to perform deep breathing. It helps you to
                    clear your head and be able to take a moment disconnected from the stressors of the outside world.
                    All it takes is a few minutes of breathing and you will feel the benefits of the exercise. During
                    the exercise it is important to focus only on your breathing and ignore any distractions that try to
                    creep in.<br><br>I encourage you to use the transitioning background as a guide for your deep
                    breathing (<a href="#meditation-breathing">other resources</a> if you prefer). I recommend breathing
                    in for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, and then breathing out for another 7 seconds. Blue
                    transitioning to pink indicates inhaling, stationary pink is for holding, and pink transitioning
                    back to blue is for exhaling.<br><br></p>
                <p class="center"><b>To start your breathing, press the play/pause button at the bottom right of your
                        screen!</b></p>

                <h1>Time Management</h1>
                <p>This has been one of my strongest skills since high school when I realized the importance of managing
                    my time. Everyone has their own system for organizing tasks, but mine is purely digital since I
                    prefer to minimize any physical items needed in my daily life. I can still appreciate people who
                    like to make physical lists and get the satisfaction of crossing off items once they are complete.
                    Below I'll list some of the tools I use to organize my life and some tips on how to use similar
                    tools to create your own system of organization.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Calendar</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would strongly recommend using a digital calendar that way you can add events quickly
                            anywhere you go and it makes sharing events as well as downloading/syncing events
                            from online easier</li>
                        <li>My calendar of choice is <a href="https://calendar.google.com" target="_blank">Google
                                Calendar</a> as it integrates well with my devices but there are <a
                                href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-calendar-apps" target="_blank">countless other
                                options</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Regardless of whether you are using a physical or digital calendar, get into the habit of
                            adding events as soon as you can so that you never miss one</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Task Manager</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not everyone wants to use a task manager/task list but I highly recommend it in addition to
                            a calendar</li>
                        <li>Using a physical list or an app for tasks makes it easy to organize current and upcoming
                            tasks that don't belong on a calendar</li>
                        <li>Like the calendar, it is only effective if you are adding tasks right away so that they
                            aren't forgotten</li>
                        <li>A physical system can be totally customizable, but if you choose to go digital then there
                            are some recommended options:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop"
                                    target="_blank">Google Tasks</a>: great as a beginner task app since it is basic but
                                has the necessary features to get started - plus it integrates with Gmail</li>
                            <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminders/id1108187841" target="_blank">Apple
                                    Reminders</a>: this is a popular choice among iPhone users as it is built-in and
                                easy-to-use - it does lack many features compared to its competitors though
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US" target="_blank">TickTick</a>: my personal
                                app of choice, it is fully loaded with all sorts of ways to organize and prioritize
                                tasks - I would only recommend this to people who are wanting more features over
                                simplicity
                            </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-to-do-list-apps/"
                                    target="_blank">Other options</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>Tips</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once you are using one or both of these tools its important to get into the habit or
                            regularly organizing and prioritizing tasks</li>
                        <li>Make sure to be concious about both short-term and long-term tasks and plan for how to
                            approach both</li>
                        <li>Be realistic with what you will accomplish in a day and pick the items ahead of time that
                            are needing to be completed versus what are bonus things to finish</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1>Sleep</h1>
                <p>Getting good sleep is important for staying energized and engaged in everyday life. It is easy to
                    fall into a trap of sleeping less in order to fill that time with other things, but this is
                    extremely detrimental to your health. I've added a great podcast episode here from The Happiness Lab
                    that discusses what can result from an extreme lack of sleep as well as strategies to improve your
                    sleeping habits.</p>

                                <li>Create a consistent bedtime routine for yourself that gets you mentally and

                                    prepared

                                <li>You should, to the best of your abilities, always follow this same routine</li>
                                <li>The routine should involve something to help you relax. E.g. Read a book for 20 min
                                </li>
                                <li>Avoid screen usage during this time or at the very least, take advantage of <a

                                <li>If you don't know, you can find it by intentionally changing the amount of sleep you
                                    get
                                    between 7 and 9 hours</li>

                                <li>Start with your current average amount of sleep and add 15 minutes to it</li>
                                <li>Once you consistently get that new amount of sleep (this might take a week or two)

                <h1>Exercise</h1>
                <p>Exercising is not everyone's favourite activity but it is important in order to stay healthy mentally
                    and physically. The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"
                        target="_blank"></a>World Health Organization recommends that adults above 18 years
                    and above should be getting at least 150 min of moderate-intensity activity or 75 min of vigorous
                    activity every week. For myself I try to incorporate physical activity into my life through
                    practical and/or fun applications. This includes biking wherever I can and playing sports instead of
                    running purely to run. Here are some tips I have to help you stay active:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick an activity that you enjoy and can get your heart rate up</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This can include activities such as walking as long as you work at increasing their
                            difficulty in order to make them at least "moderate-intensity"</li>
                        <li>An easy way to do this is to do the activity faster - this does not work/is not
                            always recommended for every exercise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Be consistent with your exercise by building it into your weekly schedule and ensuring you get
                        the recommended amount</li>
                    <li>Try to mix up your activity so that it does not become stagnant and boring</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can experiment with exercising in a new place</li>
                        <li>You can also try new activities or variations of what you currently do</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Try tracking your activity so that you get an accurate picture of your activity</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try using your phone or a smart watch if you want detailed statistics and an easier
                            way to look at all of your workouts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Exercise with a friend</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This can be great for motivating both parties to exercise better!</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
