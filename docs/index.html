            <p class="page-description">Welcome to my website dedicated to personal health.
                The goal of the site is to provide a calming space to develop and practice your self-care routine with.

                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>As you read below you will find exercises and resources for working on your self-care
                    routine. If you don't already know, <b>self-care</b> is the practice of taking action to preserve or
                    improve your health and wellbeing. Practicing self-care allows you to live healthier and happier,
                    and it better prepares you for whatever life throws at you.<br><br>The self-care content below
                    ranges in topic and you are welcome to explore the topics that interest you most. That being said, I
                    encourage you to look at every section because you may find something new that you enjoy by stepping
                    outside of your comfort zone. One last note is that throughout the site you will see landscape
                    photos as visuals. These are photos I have taken and added to the site to liven it up.</p>

                <h1>Deep Breathing</h1>
                <p>One of the easiest ways to manage stress and relax is to perform deep breathing. It helps you to
                    clear your head and be able to take a moment disconnected from the stressors of the outside world.
                    All it takes is a few minutes of breathing and you will feel the benefits of the exercise. During
                    the exercise it is important to focus only on your breathing and ignore any distractions that try to
                    creep in.<br><br>I encourage you to use the transitioning background as a guide for your deep
                    breathing (<a href="#Meditation-Breathing">other resources</a> if you prefer). I recommend breathing
                    in for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, and then breathing out for another 7 seconds. Blue
                    transitioning to pink indicates inhaling, stationary pink is for holding, and pink transitioning
                    back to blue is for exhaling.<br><br></p>
                <p class="center"><b>To start your breathing, press the play/pause button at the bottom right of your
                        screen!</b></p>

                <h1>Sleep</h1>
                <p>Getting good sleep is important for staying energized and engaged in everyday life. It is easy to
                    fall into a trap of sleeping less in order to fill that time with other things, but this is
                    extremely detrimental to your health. I've added a great podcast episode here from The Happiness Lab
                    that discusses what can result from an extreme lack of sleep as well as strategies to improve your
                    sleeping habits.</p>

                <p>Here are some of the tips I have found helpful to getting a better sleep inspired by the
                    podcast:</p>
                <ol>
                    <b>
                        <li>Create a consistent bedtime routine for yourself that gets you mentally and physically
                            prepared
                            to sleep</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The length is up to you, but somewhere between 15 and 45 min is best</li>
                        <li>You should, to the best of your abilities, always follow this same routine</li>
                        <li>The routine should involve something to help you relax. E.g. Read a book for 20 min</li>
                        <li>Avoid screen usage during this time or at the very least, take advantage of <a

                    <b>
                        <li>Find out what your optimal amount of sleep is (this should be between 7 and 9 hours)</li>
                    </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many people will already know what this amount of sleep is since they feel the most
                            well-rested afterwards</li>
                        <li>If you don't know, you can find it by intentionally changing the amount of sleep you get
                            between 7 and 9 hours</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>
                        <li>Set a goal to get your optimal amount of sleep every night and work towards it</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with your current average amount of sleep and add 15 minutes to it</li>
